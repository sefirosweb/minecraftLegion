# Installation

## Manual:

1. Clone or download the repositorio `git clone https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegion.git && cd minecraftLegion/`
2. Auto Install all the dependencies and build them `npm run build`
3. Go to server folder and create `.env` file with password

Example:
```
SERVER=localhost
PORT=25565
MASTERS=player1,player2
WEB_SERVER=http://localhost
WEB_SERVER_PORT=4001
WEB_SERVER_PASSWORD=admin
DEBUG_MODE=false
CUSTOM_START=false
AUTO_RESTART=true
ENVIRONMENT=prod
```

To update the bot execute ```git pull``` and ```npm run build```

4. Start all: `npm start`

## With docker

Create .yml file and pull the container

Example of docker-compose.yml file:
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/sefirosweb/minecraft-legion:latest
    environment:
      SERVER: host.docker.internal # Minecraft Server // "localhost" in reality is host.docker.internal 
      PORT: 25565 # Minecraft Port
      MASTERS: player1,player2 # Names of master players, separated with comma
      WEB_SERVER_PASSWORD: admin # Password to login into front end
      AUTO_RESTART: true # If bot crashes they auto reload again
      CUSTOM_START: false # If you want to do some actions before start bot, you can put here your own custom.js file (used for logging into servers)
      SECRET_TOKEN: input_here_random_text # This token is used to encrypt your session, must be randomnly and dont share it

    volumes:
      - "./botConfig:/app/core/botConfig" # Folder on saved bot configuration
      - "./custom_start:/app/core/custom_start" # Folder is execute custom start before start bot
      - "./db:/app/db" # This file stored session info and all bot config

    ports:
      - "80:80" # Web port
      - "4500-4550:4500-4550" # Ports used to attach viewers



```
## Need to do actions before start bot?
If you need to do some actions before start bot for example login, or move into some hall you can do this:

1ยบ) In .env file change to true the variable: `CUSTOM_START`

2ยบ) On start bot they create automatically a folder with file: `custom_start\custom.js`

There put all you need to do before bot starts, the function "starts" must be return a promise, when the promise is resolve all bot behavior configuration will be started


# TODO

- Optimize Sorter Job, need too many interaction with chests for sort all the items
- Add custom Sort Items in chest, based on... any idea?
- Add more behavior into Sorter Job, -> Craft items? if detect in chests no have enough of XXX items then craft it if they can? (Example swords?)
- Make an Archer Job ( During how to have this behavior similar to guard job? )
- Optimize combat Guard Job ( combat creepers, PVP, destroy shields)
- Add Job builder! based on mineflayer-builder & Schematichs
- Add placing torchs
- Check some bugs with mining job when have a too many lava or water
- Add bodyguards

Please keep calm. I'm working hard on this project :D
